Just trying to get involved. Learning Python for both work and hobbies. I'd like to try my hand a making a little game for fun, and creating an automated MASH and Fermentation controller for my home-brewing hobbies. I know somewhere out there these things already exist but I'd like to make my own and build upon it for learning and fun.
